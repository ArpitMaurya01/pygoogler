# Algorithms : 3 types 

Their are 3 different types of algos available for google searching in fgt as per use .

1.Standard Search > 

INPUT : User simply inputs total tabs to be opened , and search input.

OUTPUT : Chrome will open with first n tabs of the result from google automatically.

---------------------------------------------------------
2.Keyword Matcher >

INPUT : User simply inputs his search inputs.

OUTPUT : FGT will go through first n websites and tell how many keywords of search 
inputs are found in the website, accordingly user can open 
website which have most matching keyword (Higher chance of finding the ans.) .

---------------------------------------------------------

3.Textfile Bulk Search > INPUT : User have to make a text file and paste his text in it , and the sentences he/she wants to be get searched , shoud be enclosed with in '{' and '}' so FGT will consider the sentences inside curly brackets as SEARCH INPUTS and store them for later search.
OUTPUT : n tabs will open as user clicks enter one by one and the sentences in brackers get searched one by one.

Example : 
Input = {Jeff Bezoz} is the {Founder and Ceo of Amazon.com} and he is a man of ambitions.
Seachable List = [Jeff Bezoz ,Founder and Ceo of Amazon.com ]
